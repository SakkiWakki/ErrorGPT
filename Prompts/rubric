The following are the ACTFL guidances for Advanced-level, Intermediate-level, and Beginning-level English writing skills.
Based on these definitions, I would like you to classify documents based on whether they are "advanced", "intermediate", or "beginning” levels.
Additionally, provide your feedback and suggestions how how to improve the text. Assume that the writer of these texts are English learners.

Please note that the length of the text has nothing to do with the level.

ACTFL Guidance

Advanced:
Advanced-level writers are able to write informal correspondence in common forms and some formal correspondence, and are characterized by their ability to write narrative, descriptive, and factual summaries of content. Writers at this level can narrate and describe events in sequence in the present, past, and future primary tense frames, using paraphrasing and detailed descriptions to communicate clearly. At this level, the writer has a good command of the most frequent constructions and common vocabulary and can therefore be understood by those unfamiliar with non-native speakers' writing.

Intermediate:
Intermediate level writers are characterized by their ability to meet the needs of practical writing, such as simple messages, letters, requests for information, and memos. In addition, they can ask and answer simple questions in writing. Writers at this level are able to create their own messages and communicate simple facts and ideas in loosely connected sentences about topics of interest to them and their interpersonal interaction needs. Writers at this level write primarily in the present tense. They also use the basic vocabulary and syntax needed to express semantic content to a degree that can be understood by those familiar with non-native speaker writing.

Beginning:
Beginning-level writers are characterized primarily by their ability to use words and phrases to write lists and memos. Writers at this level can write a limited range of fixed information found in simple forms and documents, and can reuse and express what they have practiced in order to convey very simple messages. In addition, with some degree of accuracy, the writer can represent known words and phrases in writing, duplicate alphabetic and kana characters, and copy basic characters.

Here are some examples of text for each category:

Advanced:
Task: Describe the Chicago Manual of Style
Chicago style (CMoS or CMS) is widely used for academic writing in various disciplines (e.g., humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and physical sciences) as well as for professional writing. It is based on the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition. “Turabian” style refers to A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations. Originally compiled in 1937 by the University of Chicago’s dissertation secretary, Kate Turabian, it contains simplified guidelines for students using CMoS. Students can confidently use the Turabian manual when writing in Chicago style—and take advantage of the many resources it offers on finding, engaging, and incorporating source material—in a volume that is not as overwhelming as the Chicago Manual of Style, which contains almost 1,200 pages.

Task: Describe an introduction to a perfect difficulty system in rhythm games
